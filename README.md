# Jai Maa Durga â€” Static Website â€¢ Docker â†’ ECR â†’ EC2 (GitHub Actions & Terraform)

A tiny, elegant static site about Maa Durga, deployed automatically to an EC2 instance.
This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), containerization (Docker), and a production-style CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions â†’ ECR â†’ EC2 over SSH) â€” in a clean, portfolio-ready package.

âœ¨ What this project shows

Version control: clear, production-style repo layout.

Docker: site packaged as a tiny Nginx image.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions builds â†’ pushes to ECR â†’ SSH deploy to EC2.

Terraform: reproducible AWS infrastructure (EC2, Security Group, IAM, key pair).

Ops hygiene: secrets via GitHub, disk cleanup during deploy, least-privilege ECR pull.

ðŸš€ Live preview

Once deployed, open: http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/ (Terraform prints this as an output).

Tools

Git, Docker, Nginx, GitHub Actions, Amazon ECR, Amazon EC2, IAM, Security Groups, Terraform.

How to trigger CD

Push to main (or run the workflow manually); the runner builds, pushes to ECR, SSHes to EC2, pulls :latest, restarts the container, and the site updates.
